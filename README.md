### **Summary:**
This project focuses on extracting radiomics features from 3D brain tumor MRI images to analyze and classify tumors. Using libraries like `pyradiomics` and `SimpleITK`, MRI images and tumor segmentation masks were loaded. Several feature classes (first-order, shape, and texture) were extracted, targeting specific tumor regions.

The extracted features were organized in a `pandas` DataFrame and saved to a CSV for further analysis. Optional next steps include enhancing feature extraction, performing feature selection, building machine learning models, and integrating clinical data for improved tumor prediction and analysis.
